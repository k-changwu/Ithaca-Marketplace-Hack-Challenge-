Our app is a marketplace app that allows users to buy and sell items that other users list. Users can buy items that they need that other users may want to get rid of. Users can scroll through a feed that displays the items of others, and transactions are handles outside the app.

Frontend:
Uses autoLayout not storyboard 
Has delegation with multiple push and present view controllers
Utilizes a collection view
Integrated with backend


Backend: Has a lot more than 4 routes (with at least one get, post, and delete), 4 tables, API specification document, and implementation of images.
Please be nice.
