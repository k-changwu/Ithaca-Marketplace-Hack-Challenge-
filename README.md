Our app is a marketplace app that allows users to buy and sell items that other users list. Users can buy items that they need that other users may want to get rid of. Users can scroll through a feed that displays the items of others, and transactions are handles outside the app.
Frontend:

Backend: Has a lot more than 4 routes (with at least one get, post, and delete), 4 tables, API specification document, and implementation of images.
Please be nice.
